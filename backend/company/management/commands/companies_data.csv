Global Attack: Because of technological advances, the Air Force can attack anywhere, anytime and do so quickly and with greater precision than ever before.

Information Superiority: The ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan is crucial.

While our business has expanded well beyond St. Louis since then, that same sourdough starter is still used in our iconic sourdough bread and the craft of baking bread fresh each day remains at the heart of Panera Bread. Each day, our trained bakers fill our bakery shelves with delicious freshly baked cookies, pastries, bagels, and a range of breads from focaccia to classic baguettes.

We believe in serving delicious, freshly prepared, clean  food made with carefully selected ingredients that we are proud to serve our own families. Our menu, crafted by chefs and bakers, features classic, comforting dishes, each with an intriguing twist.

We respect our planet and take measures to lessen our impacts. We believe in treating people with warmth, kindness, and respect, whether it’s a guest in our cafe or one of our associates. And we believe in helping our local communities, especially in times of need.

We’re also focused on improving quality and convenience.

Building on these same founding principles, Arbonne's product line has since grown to include both inner and outer health and beauty products that are unparalleled in quality, safety, value, benefits and results!

The wonderful thing about Arbonne is that it's not just about great products, it's also about great people.

Here at Ambev, there are lots of people and amazing projects beyond our labels! Let’s talk about that.
 
We believe that having a big dream requires just the same effort as having a small one. That is why our big dream began back in the 1880s, with a team determined to make things happen and, mainly, be present in the most important and remarkable moments for each one of you: from the barley fields to your glass, at the best concerts, soccer games, social gatherings, or even that relaxing moment after a long day of work.
 
Throughout our journey, we succeeded but also made mistakes, found opportunities in a continuous learning process, took up issues, unlearned, relearned and evolved to be where we stand today. We are thousands of people in love with what we do, moved by the goal of bringing people together for a better world.
 
Beer is our great passion, as well as the people involved in our ecosystem. But our brands are not all about us. We also have incredible projects which help the world become a better place for everyone. Some examples are Ambev VOA, our bottled water AMA, our goal to end our plastic pollution by 2025, shared economy and water saving projects, and moreover. We believe that, along with society, we can make the world a better place to live in.

People don’t associate us with journeys by river, on foot or via the air, but we help with that, too. Getting people to where they need to go has been our business for over 100 years, and it shows. We’re leaders in our field, and no other city’s transport system is quite as recognisable: Red buses, black taxis, Tube trains and roundels have become icons in their own right. 

Our main job is to keep the city moving, working and growing but to do that, we have to listen. Constant improvements across the network are fuelled by feedback and comments from customers, as well as work within communities, representative groups, businesses and other London transport stakeholders. 

But our progress also depends on technology and data. With the future at our fingertips, we’ve already used it to revolutionise travel payments (think Oyster and contactless payment cards), and improved travel information. Tech and data is essential, not just to our future, but to others’: third parties use our data to power apps and services vital to customer journeys. 

So what’s next? As well as continuing to deliver Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s strategy and commitments on transport, our programme of capital investments is still one of the largest.

We are committed to providing pure, powerful products for every family and lifestyle, all infused with the life-changing benefits of our essential oils.
Our community of wellness started small in 1993, when D. Gary Young and Mary Young developed their first organic herb farming and distillation operation. At the time, Gary Young had already discovered the incredible power of essential oils, but because the quality of available oils varied so greatly, he’d been unable to fully harness their potential. Mary’s previous experience in the direct-selling industry enabled the Young's to fulfill their vision and establish a business that would empower its members to share truly pure essential oils with the world.

After establishing Young Living in 1994, the Young's developed more farmland in Utah and Idaho and began cultivating lavender, peppermint, melissa, clary sage, and many other herbs. Fueled by a growing demand for top-quality essential oils, Young Living designed and built the largest, most technologically advanced essential oil distillery in North America. In harmony with these efforts, Young Living developed its groundbreaking Seed to Seal® process, which preserves the integrity and potency of essential oils through every step of the production process.

Headquartered in Lehi, Utah, with offices in Australia, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Singapore, as well as farms around the world, Young Living stays true to the Young's original vision.
